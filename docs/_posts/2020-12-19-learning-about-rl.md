This month I was studying reinforcement learning and his implementation in Python. I was using [Open AI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) (a framework for setting the environement where the algorithm  will work), [Keras](https://keras.io/) (a framework for implementing different kinds of neural network models), [Keras-RL](https://github.com/keras-rl) (a framework for implement different kinds of reinforcement learning models based on neural network models from Keras) and I was trying to resolve the [Cartpole-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/) environment that is on [Open AI Gym docs](https://gym.openai.com/docs/).

I implemented a [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ejg5DyhgancFTpxKSPdmVjJd3o3DpCcC?usp=sharing) where I define an example of the process of implementing a reinforcement learning algorithm and training it. I adapt Open AI Gym to [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) for rendering the enviroment into [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks.
