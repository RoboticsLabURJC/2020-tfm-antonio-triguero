For this week we are still trying to find maximum speeds with the car running the software on my local computer. But this week I managed to get access to the IBM Cloud virtual servers.
The software installation process is complicated because these servers are not designed to run a graphical desktop interface. Also, you have to choose the hardware features correctly, otherwise the software may run even slower than on my local computer.
Currently, I am setting up a dedicated server with 32 cores and 64 GB of RAM which should be more than enough. This server at first was running at 10 iterations per second, which was quite a shock to me, so I find myself configuring it correctly so that it will be able to exceed the iteration speed of my computer.
In the meantime I have also achieved some results locally although it lacks some training time. The algorithm is able to do the circuit almost completely with a top speed of 10 and a slew rate of 8.
