In the week, a Formula 1 training environment based on Gazebo and ROS Noetic has been introduced. These environments allow
agent training based on reinforcement learning in the same way as they would in an OpenAi Gym environment. Available environments
they appear in the README file of the GitHub project.
At first this environment only allowed to initialize and run a single environment but currently it allows to have different environments running in the same moment.
