I started reading some books adbout Machine Learning. I prefer to focus on books about reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learnig because I think that the project will need more knownledge about this part. Also, I search information about OpenAI Gym and Duckietown. I know some tips about the first framework but the second tool is new for me.

My manager is building the work path that I should follow for providing something new to the system that he is building. I worked in projects about deep reinforcement learning but I never have work in a autonomous driving project. I think that this project can help me for learning something new about this that I can apply in my personal project about financial machine learning.
