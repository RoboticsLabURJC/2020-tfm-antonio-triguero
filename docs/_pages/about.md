This site is the perfect place for checking the progress of my post-degree final job. You can check the posts where I write a log book.

I am software engenieer and hardware engenieer graduted at University Rey Juan Carlos I and now, I am studying artificial vision at the same place. I worked at IBM for two years as full-stack developer and data sciencist and ow I work as articial intelligent enginieer at PLI Tech.

I love machine learning and financial statistics. I think that the machines can manage the capital of humans and business applicating different kinds of algorithms.
